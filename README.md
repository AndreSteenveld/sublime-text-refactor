Usage
=====

Extract Method:
Select the source code you want to extract into a new method and choose "Refactor / Extract methode" from context menu. 
This will extract the source code instantly to a new methode aka function. The plugin will manage undeclared variable usages and pass them within a single bundled JSON parameter to the new function.
It als generates a sample function call at the bottom of the new methode.
The plugin marks all variables occurring in the source code so you can rename them on the fly. 

Goto Definition:
Select a keyword or point the cursor to the keyword and choose "Goto Definition" from context menu.
